# Contributing

We follow GitHub Flow and a branch-based workflow. Please follow these guidelines when contributing.

Branches
- Branch off `main` for new work.
- Use short-lived feature branches named with a prefix, e.g. `feature/`, `fix/`, or `chore/` (e.g. `feature/can-adapter`).

Pull Requests
- Open a PR targeting `main` when your change is ready for review.
- Include a clear description of the change and any testing steps.
- Ensure CI is green and include at least one approving review before merge.

Commit messages
- Use small, focused commits with clear messages.
- Recommended convention: Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add socketcan adapter`, `fix: correct timeout handling`).

Code of Conduct
- Be respectful and collaborative.

## Local development
- Follow the instructions in `backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` to set up dev environments.
